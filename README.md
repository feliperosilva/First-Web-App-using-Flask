# First Web App using Flask
Creation of a car rental website as part of the Final Project for the course in Python Programming

In this project, the main goal was to create a website where the user can rent a vehicle from a company called Luxury Wheels
The path to renting a vehicle would be:
1. The user must first register on the website (information sent to a database)
2. After registering, the user must log in on the website (information retrieved from the database)
3. Once logged in, the user can then choose a vehicle from a list of available vehicles (availability depends on some chacks made in the database)
4. The list can be filtered
5. After choosing a vehicle, the user must choose the dates for renting. This will make the total of the renting to appear.
6. Then they procceed to the payment method and, after confirming, the vehicle is not available anymore.
7. In the page where the user can see their booking, they can edit the dates or cancel the booking.
8. If dates are changed, then the total amount will be recalculated.
9. Besides that, there is a special feature for when you log in with an admin credential.
10. Once in the admin page, you can add new vehicles to the database to increase the list of available vehicles.
